And how would you know if \"Teddy\" means a Teddy bear, Teddy Roosevelt, Teddy Sears, or the new Indian action thriller [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_(film)) secretly released on 2021? It seems it might be more helpful to know which words come after the blank. The problem of RNNs is that it misses out future information which might hold important context."
