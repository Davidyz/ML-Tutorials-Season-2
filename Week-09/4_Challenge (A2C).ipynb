    "\n",
    "So far, we managed to implement the REINFORCE agent version for the Cartpole environment. Now let's try to do the A2C one. As both models have a pretty similar structure and functioning mechanism, this notebook will contain more missing parts.\n",

    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "As it has been mentioned in Actor-Critic methods notebook, A2C algorithm has pretty similar expected return expression - the only difference is that the return function is exchanged by the advantage function.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the structural perspective, A2C model has two parts - actor and critic. Actor takes state as an input and outputs probability distribution for actions, while critic calculated values for those actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation should take the following form:\n",
    "1. Extracting environment information (state, action, etc.)\n",
    "2. Passing state through the model to generate action and critic outputs\n",
    "3. Sample action from the probability distribution\n",
    "4. Calculating rewards\n",
    "5. Comparing rewards after taken trajectory to those calculated at the start of the trajectory to generate loss\n",
